    <h1>Introducing Yowgii Inc.</h1>
    <p>Small and medium sized offices often depend on bottled-water delivery for their water needs. Bottled-water
delivery services charge $6 or more for each five gallon bottle and are an inconvenience for customers because
they become responsible for the handling and storage of up to ten bottles at a time. Many small customers have
no alternatives to bottled-water delivery services because they donâ€™t have access to a water-supply line, and
hence cannot install a bottle-less water cooler or a reverse osmosis system.
Yowgii provides an economical and convenient alternative to these customers. Yowgii generates pure drinking
water out of air. Using a patent-pending Atmospheric Water Generator to extract water vapor from air and
purifies it to generate high-quality pure drinking water. By generating water where there is no conventional
source of it, Yowgii can solve the problems that people in offices, cars, dune buggies, and camps face regularly</p>

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> How this tutorial works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>This app was deployed to Heroku by clicking the <a href="https://github.com/heroku/no-local-dev-getting-started">Heroku Button</a> in the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-heroku-and-connect-without-local-dev">tutorial</a>.</li>
        <li>Heroku Button transfers the source code for the application, transfers any app dependencies, builds and deploys the app on Heroku, and provisions a web domain for it too.</li>
        <li>The app will also provision a Heroku Postgres database, and a Heroku Connect add-on, one of over <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons">150 add-on services</a>.</li>
        <li>Heroku Connect provides seamless data synchronisation between a Heroku Postgres database and a Salesforce Org.  Clicking the "Connect with your Salesforce Org" configures Heroku Connect to perform this sync. </li>

    Please do work through the Getting Started guide, even if you do know how to build such an application.  The guide covers the basics of working with Heroku and Heroku Connect, and will familiarize you with all the concepts you need in order to build and deploy your own apps.
